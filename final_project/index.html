		<h3>"Everyone in this country should learn how to program a computer.....<br> because it teaches you how to think"</h3><span id="author">-Steve Jobs</span><br><br><br>	
		<p>Codecademy is world's largest code learning hub. Other competitors like <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">treehouse.com</a> and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">codeschool.com</a> are paid and ,moreover ,besides multiple choice they don't provide online task code editor like CodeCademy. Feature it provides are mostly free except for pro accounts. This site has more than 10 web developer courses and about 7 programming languages to master from scratch.</p><br><br><br>
		<p>Firstly, there are no videos - only written tutorials. This means the training may be a bit harder to follow. Also, many of Codecademy's lessons are written by volunteers with little or no teaching experience. As a result, some are poorly written, inconsistent with other lessons or even have bugs. When you create a free account at Codecademy, you'll get the opportunity to join groups and socialize with other coders. There's a group for every coding language and interest. In addition, every lesson at Codecademy has a Q&A forum. So if you ever get stuck, you can quickly get help from other community members. Each lesson is made up of a series of interactive coding exercises, which allow you to practice your coding right inside your web browser.</p><br><br><br>
		<p>Each exercise is accompanied by a written explanation, so you know what's going on. By far the biggest unique advantage of Codecademy is that its training covers the use of APIs, or application programming interfaces. APIs are tools that companies provide in order to grant programs access to their data.Codecademy offers lessons in how to use the APIs of YouTube, Twitter and dozens more companies. Like the rest of the training, the API lessons are free and you can practice them inside your web browser. While Codecademy won't train you to become a pro coder, it's good for learning the basic skills. You can always start at Codecademy for free and then switch to more advanced training when you're ready. The best way to find out if Codecademy is for you is to try it out for yourself.</p><br><br><br>
		<p>Perhaps the biggest downside to Codecademy is its limited depth. Its lessons only cover the basics of coding, which is not enough material to turn you into a professional coder. Plus, it doesn't teach you any supplementary skills. For example, one of the most important skills to develop in coding is the skill of producing a real, complete product - like a website or app. Codecademy only goes as far as very simple projects like web forms and date pickers. If you want training that will turn you into a professional coder, Codecademy can start you off, but you'll need more. One of the most fustration is that codecademy will go over topic once it would barely revise it again. Codecademy will teach you the syntax of a programming language, but for the most part it wonâ€™t tell you how to apply it. For example, Javascript won't tell you how to link javascript file to HTML. The Java course doesn't teach you how to compile your code in order to run it.</p><br><br><br>
		<p>In my opinion, if you ever decide to learn coding then I recommend you use Codecadmey. But if you want to be a programmer then besides just codecademy, you must do learn coding from different websites like Treehouse, codeschool and udemy.</p>
